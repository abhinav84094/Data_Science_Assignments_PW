        "- The main reason for Python’s popularity is its versatility — by learning one language, you can work in multiple domains. Additionally, it has a large community, extensive libraries, and an easy syntax, making it beginner-friendly and powerful for professionals alike."

For example we give instructions to computer in high level language and computer dont understand high level language, it understands only low-level language, so for translate high level language into low level language it needs a translator i.e. interpreter.\n",
        "- Interpreter basically compiles one line in one time. It interprete programs line by line, So it is little slower than compiler. Compiler is also a translator for computer but it is faster than interpreter because it compiles programs one in the time and gives all error in one. But interpreter interpretes programs line by line so when it triggers error in any line then it stops on that line and give error of that line."
